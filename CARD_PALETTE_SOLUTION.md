# Card Palette Solution - Fixed Card Visibility Issue

## Problem Identified
The main issue was that when users created landmarks and delves using the "Add Landmark" and "Add Delve" buttons, the cards were being added to the data store but were **not automatically placed on the map**. The cards only appeared on the map when they were in the `placedCards` array, but there was no UI to show available cards or place them on the map.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created CardPalette Component
- **Location**: `src/components/cards/CardPalette.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Shows all available landmarks and delves that haven't been placed on the map yet
- **Features**:
  - Tabbed interface (Landmarks/Delves)
  - Card previews with scaled-down versions
  - Action buttons for each card:
    - **"Place on Map"** - Automatically places the card on an available hex
    - **"Edit"** - Opens the edit form for the card
    - **"Save"** - Saves to personal library
    - **"Delete"** - Removes the card entirely
  - Collapsible design to save screen space
  - Responsive design for mobile devices

### 2. Added Card Placement Logic
- **Function**: `handlePlaceCardOnMap()` in DelveMapPage
- **Logic**: 
  - Finds an empty hex position near the center of the map
  - Uses a spiral search pattern to find available spots
  - Automatically places the card and shows success message
  - Cards can then be dragged to reposition

### 3. Updated UI Layout
- **Card Palette Position**: Fixed on the right side of the screen (desktop)
- **Mobile Responsive**: Moves to bottom of screen on mobile devices
- **Map Container**: Adjusted to make room for the card palette
- **Collapsible**: Can be collapsed to just show a small button

## How It Works Now

### Creating and Using Cards:
1. **Create a Landmark/Delve**: Click "Add Landmark" or "Add Delve" buttons
2. **Fill out the form**: Enter name, domains, etc.
3. **Submit**: Card is created and appears in the Card Palette on the right
4. **Place on Map**: Click "Place on Map" button in the Card Palette
5. **Card appears on map**: Automatically placed on an available hex
6. **Reposition**: Drag the card to move it to a different hex

### Card Palette Features:
- **Landmarks Tab**: Shows all created landmarks not yet on the map
- **Delves Tab**: Shows all created delves not yet on the map
- **Card Actions**: Each card has buttons to place, edit, save to library, or delete
- **Visual Preview**: Shows a scaled-down version of how the card will look
- **Empty State**: Shows helpful message when no cards are available

### Responsive Design:
- **Desktop**: Card palette on the right side
- **Mobile**: Card palette at the bottom, collapsible
- **Touch-friendly**: Larger buttons and touch targets on mobile
